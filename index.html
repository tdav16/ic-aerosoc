        <p> Welcome to the Imperial Airbase! All students within the department of Aeronautics are automatically members of the Imperial College Aeronautical Society (AeroSoc). We provide an outlet for all you Aeronauts to pursue your interests outside the lecture theatre and a way for all of us students to get to know each other through socials. <!--We have some fantastic first-class events planned for this year such as the crowd favourite annual Aero football tournament, karting, pub crawls, paintball, Thorpe park, CV workshops and industrial visits to various companies.--></p>
        <br>
        <p>AeroSoc holds weekly careers events during the first term where you can come and find out about ‘what you can do with an Aeronautics degree’ and get in touch with possible future employers. Our guests are reputable: Airbus, Redbull, Mercedes, Dyson etc.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Aeronauts, don’t forget that the Flight Crew is here to ensure that you have a smooth flight throughout the year; don’t hesitate to get in touch!</p>
